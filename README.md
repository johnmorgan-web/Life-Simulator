# Life Simulator

A small React port of the original single-file `index.html` app.

Quick start:

1. npm install
2. npm run dev

This scaffold uses Vite + React and splits the UI into components in `src/components`.

Next steps:
- Continue porting game logic into React hooks and context
- Add tests and TypeScript if desired
